# Conversion optimization notes
* The main heading copy explains the convenience provided by signing up.
* Subtext was added under the main heading copy to allude to a sense of missing out on a potential opportunity.
* The CTA signup button was set to a darker color to make it more prominent, and to make it stand out from the rest of the signup form.
* A preview of the weather is displayed to the side; more detailed weather information would be seen after signing up.
* Site components that would normally be present (e.g. navigation, header, footer) are absent on this page, to eliminate any potential distractions. Overall, the landing page has been kept minimalistic - this would not be the norm on the rest of the site.
